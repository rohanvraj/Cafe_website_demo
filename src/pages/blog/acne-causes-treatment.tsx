        Acne is one of the most common skin conditions affecting people of all ages. While it's often associated with teenagers, adults can suffer from it as well. Understanding what causes acne, how to treat it effectively, and ways to prevent it can help maintain healthy, clear skin.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">What Causes Acne?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Acne occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. This can lead to whiteheads, blackheads, and inflamed pimples. Hormonal changes, stress, diet, and certain medications can all contribute to breakouts.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Treatment Options</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Treatments vary based on the severity of the acne. Over-the-counter products with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide can help mild cases. For persistent or severe acne, dermatologists may prescribe topical retinoids, antibiotics, or oral treatments like isotretinoin.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Prevention Tips</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Maintaining a consistent skincare routine is key. Use non-comedogenic products, avoid touching your face, and manage stress. Regularly washing pillowcases and avoiding greasy foods can also make a difference.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">When to See a Dermatologist</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        If your acne is painful, causes scarring, or doesn’t respond to OTC treatments, it’s best to consult a dermatologist. Early intervention can prevent long-term skin damage and improve your confidence.
