      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Hydration is Everything</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Drinking enough water daily helps flush toxins from your body and keeps your skin plump and elastic. Aim for at least 8 glasses a day, and supplement with hydrating fruits like watermelon and cucumber.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Don’t Skip the Cleanser</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Cleansing twice a day removes dirt, oil, and makeup that can clog pores and cause breakouts. Choose a gentle cleanser that doesn’t strip away natural oils, especially if you have sensitive skin.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Sunscreen—Every. Single. Day.</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Sun exposure is the top cause of premature aging. Even on cloudy days or indoors, UV rays can damage your skin. Use a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen every morning, even if you don’t go outside much.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Moisturize—Twice Daily</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Moisturizers help prevent dryness and support the skin barrier. Apply after cleansing, while the skin is still slightly damp, to lock in hydration.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Gentle Exfoliation Once a Week</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Exfoliating helps remove dead skin cells, allowing new cells to surface. Use a mild chemical exfoliant like lactic or glycolic acid once or twice a week to brighten your complexion.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Healthy Diet, Healthy Skin</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Foods rich in antioxidants, omega-3s, and vitamins A, C, and E promote skin health. Incorporate leafy greens, berries, nuts, and fatty fish into your meals to support collagen production and reduce inflammation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Sleep: Your Skin’s Best Friend</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        During sleep, your skin goes into repair mode. Lack of sleep can result in dark circles, dullness, and increased stress hormones that trigger breakouts. Aim for 7–9 hours nightly.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">8. Avoid Touching Your Face</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Your hands come into contact with thousands of bacteria daily. Touching your face transfers these onto your skin, leading to clogged pores and irritation. Be mindful, and always wash hands before applying skincare.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">9. Choose the Right Products</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Not every product suits every skin type. Look for non-comedogenic products if you're acne-prone, and fragrance-free options if you have sensitive skin. Less is often more when it comes to active ingredients.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">10. See a Dermatologist Annually</h2>
      <p className="mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Skin concerns like persistent acne, pigmentation, or irritation may require professional help. An annual skin check is also crucial for early detection of skin cancer or other conditions.
      </p>

        Final Thoughts
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-2 mb-12">
        Great skin is a combination of good habits, patience, and self-awareness. Start small—add one or two new tips to your daily routine—and stay consistent. Your skin will thank you!
